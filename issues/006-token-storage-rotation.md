# 6. Token Storage and Rotation

## Description
`src/utils/encryption.ts` defines interfaces with `TOKEN_STORE` and `ROTATION_LOCK` but these environment variables are not used elsewhere in the codebase. The process for key rotation and re-encryption is unclear.

## Suggested Fixes
Document or implement the token rotation workflow and remove unused environment variables if they are not required.
